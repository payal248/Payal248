## Hi there 👋
# 👋 Hi, I'm Payal — AI Developer | GCP Engineer | Tech Educator

Welcome to my world of applied AI, data pipelines, and intelligent tools that actually make work easier.

## 🔧 What I Build
- 🧠 **AI-powered Document Tools** — LLMs, LangChain, embeddings for clause comparison & summarization. 
- ☁️ **GCP Data Workflows** — BigQuery, Dataflow, Vertex AI for scalable data pipelines. This one communicated with SAP and helped simplify 5 days task into 1 hour.
- 📊 **Machine Learning Applications** — From tabular insights to anomaly detection and NLP

## ✨ Why Work With Me?
I don’t just code—I **communicate technology**.

Whether you're a founder, a learner, or a team lead, I help **break down the complex**. My work is designed to **explain itself**, and I’m always up for making the toughest tech easy to grasp.
